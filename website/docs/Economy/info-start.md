# Getting Started

```css
  ----------------------------- Lewd Labs -----------------------------------
  Thanks for checking our this package! Please leave a star on Github!
  ----------------------------- Economy -------------------------------------
 ```


This is the guide for our discord bot economy system using mongodb. The source code guide can be found [here.](https://lewd-labs.github.io/Economy/)

## Who can use this package?

This package can be used by anyone and any project not just discord bots. However, I am developing this for discord bots first. The Economy Packages is build with typescript and supports type defs.

This guide will assume you already know how to make a somewhat basic discord bot with javascript and want to implement our package into your project.
